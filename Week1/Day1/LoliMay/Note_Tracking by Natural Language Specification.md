# Note Tracking by Natural Language Specification (PART1)

## Abstract
track a target object in a video based on a natural language specification of the target.

### propose three variants
1. relying on lingual target specification only
2. relying on visual target specification based on language
3. leveraging their joint capacity

### other works
1. extend two popular tracking datasets with lingual descriptions
2. report experiments
3. sketch new tracking scenarios

## Introduction
track an object in video

### Recent progress in object retrieval
a RNN able to localize an object in an image by a natural language query only

### Contribution
1. tracking by natural language specification
2. three variants
