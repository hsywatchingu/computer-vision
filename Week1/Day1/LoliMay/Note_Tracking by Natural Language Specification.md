# Note Tracking by Natural Language Specification (PART1)

## Abstract
track a target object in a video based on a natural language specification of the target.

### propose three variants
1. relying on lingual target specification only
2. relying on visual target specification based on language
3. leveraging their joint capacity

### other works
1. extend two popular tracking datasets with lingual descriptions
2. report experiments
3. sketch new tracking scenarios
